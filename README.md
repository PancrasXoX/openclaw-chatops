# openclaw-chatops

OpenClaw + chat/messaging platforms (starting with Discord).

## Goals
- Discord-first integration, done well.
- Heartbeat-driven scheduled workflows (standups, digests, reminders) that leverage OpenClaw features.
- A clear platform capability matrix so we can decide what (if anything) to support beyond Discord.

## Repo structure (WIP)
- `docs/` — SOPs, capability matrix, design notes
- `src/` — implementation code
- `scripts/` — local dev helpers

## Status
Bootstrapping.
